        <h2>Purpose Of CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that is used in combination with HTML that customizes how HTML elements will appear. CSS can define styles and change the layout and design of a sheet.</p>

        <table>
            <thead> <!--Because this is a heading, we add this code-->
                <tr> <!-- Row 1 - Row Titles (Tag, name, description)-->

                    <td>Matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute. For selecting elements having calendar-cell as the value of the class attribute, a . needs to be prepended.</td>

                    <td>Matches elements based on the contents of their id attribute. The values of id attribute should be unique in the entire DOM. For selecting the element having job-title as the value of the id attribute, a # needs to be prepended.</td>

                <td> Descendant Selector</td>
                <td>Used to match elements that are descended from another matched selector. They are denoted by a single space between each selector and the descended selector. All matching elements are selected regardless of the nesting level in the HTML.</td>

                <td>h1#header {}</td>
                <td>Selector Specificity</td>
                <td>Specificity is a ranking system that is used when there are multiple conflicting property values that point to the same element. When determining which rule to apply, the selector with the highest specificity wins out. The most specific selector type is the ID selector, followed by class selectors, followed by type selectors. In this example, only color: blue will be implemented as it has an ID selector whereas color: red has a type selector.</td>
